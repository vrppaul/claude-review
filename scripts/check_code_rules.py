"""Check the two code rules no linter here can be told to keep.

No function is defined inside another: a helper is a function of its
module, with a name and parameters of its own, not a closure in the body of
something else. A lambda is still allowed where a short one does.

No name is too short to say what it holds: `index`, not `i`; `error`, not
`e`. A few words are short and still say what they mean, and `_` says that
nothing is kept.

Run on files or directories, in the project's own environment, as the
pre-commit hook runs it and CI runs the hook:

    uv run python scripts/check_code_rules.py src scripts

Prints each place that breaks a rule and exits 1, or says nothing and exits 0.
